This is basic Linear Model build on Jupyter Notebook. 
The Dataset here is from the online course I was doing from Udemy on Data Science. 

## Problem Statement

Now the second hand car company wants to build a model where they can predict the if they can close the deal on higher amount to add more profits. They gave us the data of previous sales done by there best sales-persons and asked us to build a model to predict the best price company can offer to customer to close the deal
